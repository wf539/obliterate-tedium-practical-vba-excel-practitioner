In this course, you’ll learn about ways to automate data preparation using short programs in VBA, the native programming language bundled with and built into Excel.

Play by Play is a series in which top technologists work through a problem in real time, unrehearsed, and unscripted. In this course, Play by Play: Obliterate the Tedium - Practical VBA for the Excel Practitioner, Ryan Hinkle and Don Robins demonstrate that with less than 50 lines of code you can create powerful programs for any highly repetitive process to automate tasks, including moving among sheets, rows, and columns to retrieve and output data in exactly the format you seek. Learn the basics of configuring the Developer Environment in Excel, various programming elements required to script simple yet powerful macros, and how to design and construct pseudo code. By the end of this course, you’ll have a clear understanding of just what you can accomplish with VBA macros in Excel, and you’ll come away with some tools and samples to apply to your own transformation tasks, leveraging the powerful capabilities of the embedded programming environment.
